# Optimization

Optimization, also known as mathematical programming, collection of mathematical principles and methods used for solving quantitative problems in many disciplines, including physics, biology, engineering, economics, and business. The subject grew from a realization that quantitative problems in manifestly different disciplines have important mathematical elements in common. Because of this commonality, many problems can be formulated and solved by using the unified set of ideas and methods that make up the field of optimization.
This repository is mainly about my implementations in various subjects of the mathematical optimizations. 

### Convex Optimization

- [CVX Opt](./Convex-Optimization/): This folder contains the implementations about convex optimization problems, most of which are based on the exercises of the Convex Optimization text-book by Stephen P. Boyd. Further information is avilable on [CVX OPT Readme](./Convex-Optimization/README.md).

### Numerical Optimization

- [Numerical Opt](./Numerical-Optimization/): This folder contains the implementations about numerical optimization methods, most of which are based on the algorithms of the Numerical Optimization text-book by by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright. Besides, it contains some recent optimization papers' implementations. Further information is avilable on [CVX OPT Readme](./Numerical-Optimization/README.md).
