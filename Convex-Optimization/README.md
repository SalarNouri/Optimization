# Convex Optimization

Convex optimization is a branch of mathematical optimization focused on minimizing convex functions over convex sets or maximizing concave functions over convex sets. Unlike many other optimization problems, certain types of convex optimization problems can be solved in polynomial time. 

This field has broad applications across various domains, including automatic control systems, estimation and signal processing, communications and networks, electronic circuit design, data analysis and modeling, finance, statistics (optimal experimental design), and structural optimization. Recent developments in computation and optimization algorithms have made convex programming more accessible and as understandable as linear programming.
