## Convex Optimization
A branch of mathematical optimization known as "convex optimization" deals with the issue of minimizing convex functions over convex sets (or, equivalently, maximizing concave functions over convex sets). While mathematical optimization is typically NP-hard, certain types of convex optimization problems allow polynomial-time techniques.

Automatic control systems, estimation and signal processing, communications and networks, electronic circuit design, data analysis and modeling, finance, statistics (optimal experimental design), and structural optimization are just a few of the fields where convex optimization has applications. These fields have successfully applied the approximation concept. Convex programming is now practically as simple to understand as linear programming thanks to recent developments in computation and optimization algorithms.
